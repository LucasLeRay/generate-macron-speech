Do you say yes then we will provide an answer to that. In fact, as we did in the spring, it is quite true that in terms of health, I was saying this earlier. The virus affects more modest environments because you live in smaller apartments because you often live between generations much more than you can afford to have an apartment. Uh, here we are, uh, adult teenager. The second thing is that, in the economic and social context of this crisis, it is also unequal. Why? Because the jobs that have been destroyed are mostly fixed-term and temporary jobs, that is, more. And so that's also why I assume the strength of the economic response we have had. And there, report also said very clearly. We are undoubtedly the country in Europe that has been the strongest on this subject, which has invested the most EUR 4 hundred and sixty billion. And we will continue to do so, as I said exceptionally. But in fact, the most precarious who fall into poverty, we must have an answer. And so what we are going to do, because it is the broadest and most effective scheme, is for the beneficiaries of the RSA and the LPA. This affects all young people, there also very largely the eighteen and twenty five years of having exceptional help there, during these six weeks which come from one hundred and fifty euros plus one hundred euros per child, the same as what we did precisely in the spring, which will allow us to go between one hundred and four hundred and fifty euros, which is more than a revaluation. But I also want one thing: that we do not lose our fundamentals, our fundamentals, it is the fight against poverty, through the return to activity, work and the more we unilaterally increase all our social minima. The rebels never make it difficult to return to activity again. That's what we found out. And that's also why I assume, a few months ago, that I have massively, historically increased the activity premium at the level of the Smic by one hundred euros a month. And so I prefer this exceptional, massive aid comparable to what we did in the spring rather than a social minima transformation. And when we talk about social minima, I also want to reiterate here that the minimum old age and the disabled adult allowance have, since the beginning of this quinquennium, an historic increase. Almost one hundred euros per month. Mr. Speaker, there are just a few moments left. I'm going to ask you a question that makes sense I imagine for many French people, the description of what you are doing to us, the future of the virus that will probably last until next summer. Uh, from several cities. Twenty million people who are going to be a little bit under the bells of twenty-one o'clock at six o'clock in the morning, it's pretty dark and what has a reason, a reason to hope that we are twenty years old, sixty five years old or older. There is a lot of reason to hope. If we are lucid, the collective united, lucid, that is, I ensure that the information is transparent and shared. I believe we are the first country in the world to have requested an evaluation report for the first phase. It has been made public. Health data are shared like economic data all the time. I think it is necessary in the land of Enlightenment and Pasteur that we stop having some kind of permanent debate on facts or scientific truth. There is a scientific council that plays an essential role. It is going to be perpetuated. I thank its members, but here we have some certainties. Sixty given to the facts and not say every day. This is nothing, we can do that way. So if we rely on them, we can say it's serious, it's serious but mobilize. The reason for hope I'll tell you, is that we are relearning to be fully one, that is, we were gradually accustomed to being a society of free individuals. We are a nation of solidarity citizens. We cannot get out of it if everyone does not play their part. Here's the key. And so, I say it very clearly, the message that I came to pass. It is that I need each one of you, that we need each other to find solutions to invent, to be citizens, respecting the rules, for ourselves and for others, but above all to invent. We will get out of this by being a more resilient nation. We're going to continue to overcome our challenges. We will continue to resolve the climate crisis and the climate transition, but we will also, and we are doing so, learn a more resilient nation that will produce economy, life on its territory. Once again, we're going to reproduce drugs, necessary materials, which resonates to protect ourselves and overcome this crisis like any other. We'll come out stronger because we'll be more united. That's what we need from each other if I had a message to pass on to our fellow citizens. We'll make it together. That was the last word. Thank you very much, Mr President, for having received us. Anne Sophie, thank you, thank you and we'll get there. We'll get there. Very good evening to all
